a web app that helps you plan your lunch - less lunch planning, more eating (formerly of justgetlunch.com)

PHP CodeIgniter with Yelp and Google Apps integration.

Planning lunch with coworkers sucks

And you care a lot more what your coworkers think about a restaurant than what random Yelper do

Wouldn't you rather see reviews for places where you have lunch with your lunch buddies?

Wouldn't you like to take a poll of places to go, figure out transportation, etc, without sucky email threads?

Never eat alone again

Wouldn't you like to have lunch and network with other industry experts near you?

Find out who else likes that obscure sushi place and eats at the same time as you, and become lunch buddies
